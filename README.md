# Deloitte-Data-Analytics-Job-Simulation-
This project, part of the Deloitte Job Simulation (Forage) completed in June-July, analyzes employee compensation data. It classifies 'Equality Scores' into 'Fair,' 'Unfair,' and 'Highly Discriminative' categories, presenting the findings in a visually enhanced, structured table for clear insights into compensation equality trends.
